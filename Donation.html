                            The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is a Swiss-based international non-governmental organization founded in 1961 dedicated to wilderness conservation and reducing human impact on the environment. It was formerly known as the World Wildlife Fund and still retains its official name in Canada and the United States. WWF is the world's largest conservation organization, with more than 5 million supporters worldwide, working in more than 100 countries and supporting approximately 3,000 conservation and environmental projects. Since 1995, they have invested more than $1 billion in more than 12,000 conservation initiatives. WWF is a foundation that in 2020 received 65% of its funding from individuals and bequests, 17% from government sources (such as the World Bank, DFID, and USAID), and 8% from corporations.

WWF's goal is to "stop the degradation of the Earth's natural environment and build a future where humans and nature live in harmony." WWF has published the Living Planet Report every two years since 1998; it is based on the Living Planet Index and Ecological Footprint calculations. In addition, WWF has launched a number of well-known global events, including Earth Hour and Debt for Nature, and its current work revolves around the following six areas: food, climate, freshwater, wildlife, Forest and ocean.

WWF has been criticized for its corporate ties and support for conservation measures that have led to violent conflicts with local people. WWF is part of the steering group of the Foundation Platform F20, an international network of foundations and philanthropic organizations.
